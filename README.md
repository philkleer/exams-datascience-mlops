# Data Science & MLOps Training - Exam Solutions

Welcome to my repository showcasing the solutions to various exams taken during my Data Science and MLOps training. This repository serves as a structured collection of my learning journey, covering key topics such as Python, Bash, Docker, JQ, Airflow, BentoML, DVC, Evidently, Kubernetes, and more. 🚀
